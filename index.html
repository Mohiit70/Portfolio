    <h3>ðŸ‘‹ Yo, welcome to my code hub! I'm your 20-year-old computer science Student</h3>

    <p>With a passion for community, cloud tech, DevOps, and full stack development. Currently on the lookout for a
        developer role where I can use my skills to make a positive impact. I love participating in hackathons and
        building personal projects. Feel free to connect with me for the next hackathon!</p>

    <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy graphic design and create visuals for my projects using Canva.</p>

    <p>I'm a core team member of DecodeCafe, a student community helping others in tech. As a Microsoft Learn Student
        Ambassador, I lead sessions to share knowledge. In my free time, I'm exploring web3 tech.</p>

    <p>I'm highly motivated, self-driven, and always eager to learn. Confident in my skills, I'm excited to find an
        opportunity to make a difference.</p>
