    <p>I am a 20-year-old computer science student with a passion for community, cloud tech, DevOps, open source, and cloud native technologies. I am currently looking for a developer role where I can use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world.

        In my spare time, I enjoy participating in hackathons, contributing to open source projects, and building personal projects using cloud computing technologies, DevOps tools, and cloud native technologies. I am also a graphic designer and use Canva to create graphics for my personal projects and social media accounts.
        
        I am the founder of TriCore Co, an open community for all level developers to collaborate and build tools for developers. It is currently in the early stages of development, but I am excited to see how it grows and helps developers all over the world.
        
        I am a highly motivated and self-driven individual with a strong work ethic. I am also a team player and I am always eager to learn new things. I am confident that I have the skills and knowledge necessary to be a successful developer, and I am excited to find an opportunity where I can use my talents to make a difference.</p>
